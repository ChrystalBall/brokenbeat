In collaboration with <a href="http://happycog.com/">Happy Cog</a> and the community  we&#8217;ve taken the first major step forward in the WordPress interface since version 1.5.</p>\n<p><strong>Dashboard Widgets</strong> &#8212; the dashboard home page is now a series of widgets, including ones to show you fun stats about your posting, latest comments, people linking to you, new and popular plugins, and of course WordPress news. You can customize any of the dashboard widgets to show, for example, news from your local paper instead of WP news. Plugins can also hook in, for example the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/stats/">WordPress.com stats widget</a> adds a handy double-wide stats box.</p>\n<p><img src="http://s.wordpress.org/screenshots/2.5/stats-widget.png" alt="" width="690" /></p>\n<p><strong>Multi-file upload with progress bar</strong> &#8212; before when you would upload a large file you&#8217;d wait forever, never knowing how far along it was. And uploading more than one photo was an exercise in patience, as you could only do one at a time. Now you can select a whole of folder images or music or videos at once and it&#8217;ll show you the progress of each upload.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus: EXIF extraction</strong> &#8212; if you upload JPEG files with EXIF metadata like camera make and model, aperture, shutter speed, ISO, et al. WordPress will extract all the data into custom fields you can use in your template. If you use the EXIF title fields or similar those will be put into their equivalent fields in WP. Most modern digital cameras generate EXIF data.</p>\n<p><strong>Search posts and pages</strong> &#8212; search used to cover just posts, now it includes pages too, a great boon for thoe using WordPress as a CMS. New themes can style or sort pages differently in results.</p>\n<p><strong>Tag management</strong> &#8212; you can now add, rename, delete, and do whatever else you like to tags from inside WordPress, no plugins needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Password strength meter</strong> &#8212; when you change your password on your profile it&#8217;ll tell you how strong your password is to help you pick a good one.</p>\n<p><strong>Concurrent editing protection</strong> &#8212; for those of you on multi-author blogs, have you ever opened a post while someone was already editing it, and your auto-saves kept overwriting each other, irrecoverably losing hours of work? I bet that added a few words to your vocabulary. Now if you open a post that someone else is editing, WordPress magically locks it and prevents you from saving until the other person is done. You&#8217;ll see a message like below.</p>\n<p><img src="http://s.wordpress.org/screenshots/2.5/write-currently-editing.png" alt="" /></p>\n<p><strong>Few-click plugin upgrades</strong> &#8212; if the plugins you use are part of the plugin directory since 2.3 we&#8217;ve told you when they have an update available. Now we take that to the next logical step &#8212; downloading and installing the upgrade for you. This is dependent a little bit on your host setup, and it may ask you for your FTP password much like OS X or Windows will ask you for a password, but it works well on majority of hosts we were able to test, your mileage may very, plugins in mirror may be larger than they appear.</p>\n<p><strong>Friendlier visual post editor</strong> &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure how to articulate this improvement except to say &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t mess with your code anymore.&#8221; We&#8217;re now using version 3.0 of TinyMCE, which means better compatibility with Safari, and we&#8217;ve paid particular attention this release to its integration and interaction with complex HTML. It also now has a &#8220;no-distractions&#8221; mode which is like Writeroom for your browser.</p>\n<p><strong>Built-in galleries</strong> &#8212; when you take advantage of multi-file upload to upload a bunch of photos, we have a new shortcode that lets you to easily embed galleries by just putting [ gallery] (without the space) in your post. It&#8217;ll display all your thumbnails and captions and each will link each to a page where people can comment on the individual photos. I&#8217;ve been using this feature on my blog and have already uploaded over <a href="http://ma.tt/category/gallery/">1,200 pictures into 23 galleries</a>. The shortcode has some hidden options too, <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_the_gallery_shortcode">check out this documentation</a>.</p>\n<h3>Developer Features</h3>\n<p>Now for the geeky stuff. While we&#8217;re excited about the above features, each one represents a new opportunity or API for other developers to take to another level. (The best of which we&#8217;ll someday integrate back into WP.)</p>\n<p><strong>Salted passwords</strong> &#8212; we now use the <a href="http://www.openwall.com/phpass/">phpass</a> library to stretch and salt all passwords stored in the database, which makes brute-forcing them impractical. If you use something like <a href="http://modauthmysql.sourceforge.net/">mod_auth_mysql</a> we&#8217;ve <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/md5-password-hashes/">created a plugin that will allow you to use legacy MD5 hashing</a>. (The hashing is completely pluggable.) Users will automatically switch to the more secure passwords next time they log in.</p>\n<p><strong>Secure cookies</strong> &#8212; cookies are now encrypted based on the protocol described <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~alexliu/publications/Cookie/cookie.pdf">in this PDF paper</a>. which is something like <code>user name|expiration time|HMAC( user name|expiration time, k)</code> where <code>k = HMAC(user name|expiration time, sk)</code> and where <code>sk</code> is a secret key, which you can define in your config.</p>\n<p><strong>Easy taxonomy and URL creation</strong> &#8212; probably best illustrated with an example: I can call <code>register_taxonomy()</code> with <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/6357/taxes.php">a few arguments</a> to register a &#8220;people&#8221; taxonomy and whenever I edit an image I&#8217;ll see a UI like tags has for identifying the people in a photo, and these will be URL addressable with <code>/person/firstname-lastname/</code>. All with a single function call.</p>\n<p><strong>Inline documentation</strong> &#8212; the vast majority of the new code going into WordPress include inline documentation that explains the functions and documents their arguments.</p>\n<p><strong>Database optimization</strong> &#8212; we haven&#8217;t changed the table layout in this release, which is one of the reasons so many plugins work fine with 2.5. We have added a few new indicies and made a few default fields more flexible based on some bottlenecks we found on WordPress.com, which now hosts 2.7 million WordPress blogs. It should be invisible to the application, just a bit faster on the database side.</p>\n<p><strong>$wpdb->prepare()</strong> &#8212; now almost all of the SQL in WordPress is prepared first, and the same functions are available to your plugins. This should prevent elementary SQL escaping issues.</p>\n<p><strong>Media buttons</strong> &#8212; the add media buttons above the post are both expandable, so you could have an &#8220;Add Google Map&#8221; button if you like, They can be overridden, so if you think you can do the video or audio tab better than we have you can replace the default.</p>\n<p><strong>Shortcode API</strong> &#8212; the new gallery functionality is powered by the new shortcode API. Shortcodes are little bracket-delineated strings that can be magically expanded at runtime to something more interesting. They give users a short, easy to type and copy/paste string they can move around their post without worrying about messing up complex HTML or embed codes. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API">The Shortcode API is fully documented</a>.</p>\n<p>Now you see why 2.5 took a little extra time. <img src=''http://wordpress.org/development/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif'' alt='':)'' class=''wp-smiley'' /> </p>\n<h3>Upgrade Notes</h3>\n<p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress">The upgrade instructions for this version are pretty much the same as any other version</a>. The most important thing to check is your plugins, so if for example everything works except the new uploader, a legacy plugin might be causing a javascript error on the page and breaking it. If something goes wrong, the safest thing to do is turn your plugins off (we have a button to do them all at once, now) and turn them back on one-by-one, testing the problem along the way. This has solved almost everybody&#8217;s problems in testing, and it also lets you know which plugin author to show some love to so they&#8217;ll update their plugin, and which plugin authors already have so you can shower them with praises on your blog.</p>\n<p>One brief note about some of the new upload and plugin upgrade features, there are some edge-case hosting platforms, like versions of Lighttpd before 1.5 or over-agressive mod_security rules, which can break. If something isn&#8217;t working like it was looked in the screenshot, ask your host if there&#8217;s something on the server side which may be interfering. Hosts, feel free to join and post to <a href="http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-testers">our wp-testers mailing list</a> if you have an environment that requires some extra code to work around. We&#8217;d be happy to include it in the next update.</p>\n<p><em>Quick tip:</em> in 2.5 you click the name of things to edit them, like your username to edit your profile or the title of a post to edit it.</p>\n<h3>The Community is Growing</h3>\n<p>More than growing, it&#8217;s on fire. We always talk about things like downloads, and the 2.3 branch has already had <strong>1.92 million downloads</strong> as I write this post, but this time we have some far more interesting information I&#8217;d like to share.</p>\n<p>There were over 1,200 commits to our repository since 2.3.0 and <strong>over 90 people were credited</strong> in them. This means in our core code, not plugins, there were at least 90 individual folks that contributed something high-quality enough that it made the cut to be part of the download you guys get today. I had no idea this group of people was so large.</p>\n<p>Outside of the <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/">core commit team</a>, there was particular help from these people, in rough order of number of credits and tickets: <a href="http://blogwaffe.com/">mdawaffe (Michael Adams)</a>, <a href="http://www.laptoptips.ca/">azaozz (Andrew Ozz)</a>, <a href="http://nb.niichavo.org/">nbachiyski (Nikolay Bachiyski)</a>, <a href="http://skeltoac.com/">andy (Andy Skelton)</a>, <a href="http://iammattthomas.com/">iammattthomas (Matt Thomas)</a>, <a href="http://thresholdstate.com/">tellyworth (Alex Shiels)</a>, <a href="http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/">josephscott (Joseph Scott)</a>, <a href="http://foolswisdom.com/">lloydbudd (Lloyd Budd)</a>, <a href="http://dd32.id.au/">DD32 (Dion)</a>, <a href="http://www.ilfilosofo.com/">filosofo (Austin Matzko)</a>, <a href="http://engel.uk.to/">hansengel (Hans Engel)</a>, <a href="http://www.freecharity.org.uk/">pishmishy</a>, ffemtcj, <a href="http://www.viper007bond.com/">Viper007Bond</a>, <a href="http://extralogical.net/">ionfish (Benedict Eastaugh)</a>, <a href="http://www.poplarware.com/">jhodgdon (Jennifer Hodgdon)</a>, <a href="http://ottodestruct.com/blog/">Otto42</a>, <a href="http://www.cefm.ca/">thee17 (Charles E. Free-Melvin)</a>, and <a href="http://www.buayacorp.com/">xknown</a>. Also want to thank MichaelH and Lorelle on the documentation side, and moshu, Kafkaesqui, whooami, MichaelH, Otto42, and jeremyclark13 for helping with support.</p>\n<p>The 2.5 branch is nicknamed &#8220;Brecker&#8221; in honor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Brecker">Michael Brecker</a>, an exceptionally talented saxophonist who could cross styles effortlessly and never stopped experimenting and pushing himself until he passed away last year.</p>\n<h3>New WordPress.org</h3>\n<p>All of this wasn&#8217;t enough, so in our copious spare time we decided to redesign WordPress.org to better match the aesthetics of the new dashboard and also to spruce up a few areas that needed lovin&#8217;. Some parts of the site, like the Codex, might show the old style for a day or two. We know, just give us a bit of time. Thanks to <a href="http://iammattthomas.com/">Matt Thomas</a> for his epic effort in designing and coding the new site.</p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s Next</h3>\n<p>As always with WordPress, we don&#8217;t claim any of these features to be perfect, or to be better than everyone else in the world, but they are done by and for the people and the one thing we do promise is that with every release we listen and do our best to improve. </p>\n<p>2.5 is a major milestone for WordPress not because it added dozens of user-requested features, but because it reaffirms that we&#8217;re as passionate about blogging as the day we started. Our community is too fierce to rest on its laurels &#8212; contrary to what pundits claim, blogging is far from &#8220;finished&#8221; and every improvement just whets our appetite for more. And more is coming.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a good thing WordPress doesn&#8217;t limit the length of posts, because this one would have hit it. If you made it this far, thanks for sharing a bit of your day with us. I sincerely hope this new version of WordPress helps you do what you love to do.</p>\n";}s:3:"wfw";a:1:{s:10:"commentrss";s:67:"http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-brecker/feed/";}s:7:"summary";s:391:"WordPress 2.5, the culmination of six months of work by the WordPress community, people just like you.

New themes can style or sort pages differently in results.</p>\n<p><strong>Tag management</strong> &#8212; you can now add, rename, delete, and do whatever else you like to tags from inside WordPress, no plugins needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Password strength meter</strong> &#8212; when you change your password on your profile it&#8217;ll tell you how strong your password is to help you pick a good one.</p>\n<p><strong>Concurrent editing protection</strong> &#8212; for those of you on multi-author blogs, have you ever opened a post while someone was already editing it, and your auto-saves kept overwriting each other, irrecoverably losing hours of work? I bet that added a few words to your vocabulary. Now if you open a post that someone else is editing, WordPress magically locks it and prevents you from saving until the other person is done. You&#8217;ll see a message like below.</p>\n<p><img src="http://s.wordpress.org/screenshots/2.5/write-currently-editing.png" alt="" /></p>\n<p><strong>Few-click plugin upgrades</strong> &#8212; if the plugins you use are part of the plugin directory since 2.3 we&#8217;ve told you when they have an update available. Now we take that to the next logical step &#8212; downloading and installing the upgrade for you. This is dependent a little bit on your host setup, and it may ask you for your FTP password much like OS X or Windows will ask you for a password, but it works well on majority of hosts we were able to test, your mileage may very, plugins in mirror may be larger than they appear.</p>\n<p><strong>Friendlier visual post editor</strong> &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure how to articulate this improvement except to say &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t mess with your code anymore.&#8221; We&#8217;re now using version 3.0 of TinyMCE, which means better compatibility with Safari, and we&#8217;ve paid particular attention this release to its integration and interaction with complex HTML. It also now has a &#8220;no-distractions&#8221; mode which is like Writeroom for your browser.</p>\n<p><strong>Built-in galleries</strong> &#8212; when you take advantage of multi-file upload to upload a bunch of photos, we have a new shortcode that lets you to easily embed galleries by just putting [ gallery] (without the space) in your post. It&#8217;ll display all your thumbnails and captions and each will link each to a page where people can comment on the individual photos. I&#8217;ve been using this feature on my blog and have already uploaded over <a href="http://ma.tt/category/gallery/">1,200 pictures into 23 galleries</a>. The shortcode has some hidden options too, <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_the_gallery_shortcode">check out this documentation</a>.</p>\n<h3>Developer Features</h3>\n<p>Now for the geeky stuff. While we&#8217;re excited about the above features, each one represents a new opportunity or API for other developers to take to another level. (The best of which we&#8217;ll someday integrate back into WP.)</p>\n<p><strong>Salted passwords</strong> &#8212; we now use the <a href="http://www.openwall.com/phpass/">phpass</a> library to stretch and salt all passwords stored in the database, which makes brute-forcing them impractical. If you use something like <a href="http://modauthmysql.sourceforge.net/">mod_auth_mysql</a> we&#8217;ve <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/md5-password-hashes/">created a plugin that will allow you to use legacy MD5 hashing</a>. (The hashing is completely pluggable.) Users will automatically switch to the more secure passwords next time they log in.</p>\n<p><strong>Secure cookies</strong> &#8212; cookies are now encrypted based on the protocol described <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~alexliu/publications/Cookie/cookie.pdf">in this PDF paper</a>. which is something like <code>user name|expiration time|HMAC( user name|expiration time, k)</code> where <code>k = HMAC(user name|expiration time, sk)</code> and where <code>sk</code> is a secret key, which you can define in your config.</p>\n<p><strong>Easy taxonomy and URL creation</strong> &#8212; probably best illustrated with an example: I can call <code>register_taxonomy()</code> with <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/6357/taxes.php">a few arguments</a> to register a &#8220;people&#8221; taxonomy and whenever I edit an image I&#8217;ll see a UI like tags has for identifying the people in a photo, and these will be URL addressable with <code>/person/firstname-lastname/</code>. All with a single function call.</p>\n<p><strong>Inline documentation</strong> &#8212; the vast majority of the new code going into WordPress include inline documentation that explains the functions and documents their arguments.</p>\n<p><strong>Database optimization</strong> &#8212; we haven&#8217;t changed the table layout in this release, which is one of the reasons so many plugins work fine with 2.5. We have added a few new indicies and made a few default fields more flexible based on some bottlenecks we found on WordPress.com, which now hosts 2.7 million WordPress blogs. It should be invisible to the application, just a bit faster on the database side.</p>\n<p><strong>$wpdb->prepare()</strong> &#8212; now almost all of the SQL in WordPress is prepared first, and the same functions are available to your plugins. This should prevent elementary SQL escaping issues.</p>\n<p><strong>Media buttons</strong> &#8212; the add media buttons above the post are both expandable, so you could have an &#8220;Add Google Map&#8221; button if you like, They can be overridden, so if you think you can do the video or audio tab better than we have you can replace the default.</p>\n<p><strong>Shortcode API</strong> &#8212; the new gallery functionality is powered by the new shortcode API. Shortcodes are little bracket-delineated strings that can be magically expanded at runtime to something more interesting. They give users a short, easy to type and copy/paste string they can move around their post without worrying about messing up complex HTML or embed codes. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API">The Shortcode API is fully documented</a>.</p>\n<p>Now you see why 2.5 took a little extra time. <img src=''http://wordpress.org/development/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif'' alt='':)'' class=''wp-smiley'' /> </p>\n<h3>Upgrade Notes</h3>\n<p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress">The upgrade instructions for this version are pretty much the same as any other version</a>. The most important thing to check is your plugins, so if for example everything works except the new uploader, a legacy plugin might be causing a javascript error on the page and breaking it. If something goes wrong, the safest thing to do is turn your plugins off (we have a button to do them all at once, now) and turn them back on one-by-one, testing the problem along the way. This has solved almost everybody&#8217;s problems in testing, and it also lets you know which plugin author to show some love to so they&#8217;ll update their plugin, and which plugin authors already have so you can shower them with praises on your blog.</p>\n<p>One brief note about some of the new upload and plugin upgrade features, there are some edge-case hosting platforms, like versions of Lighttpd before 1.5 or over-agressive mod_security rules, which can break. If something isn&#8217;t working like it was looked in the screenshot, ask your host if there&#8217;s something on the server side which may be interfering. Hosts, feel free to join and post to <a href="http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-testers">our wp-testers mailing list</a> if you have an environment that requires some extra code to work around. We&#8217;d be happy to include it in the next update.</p>\n<p><em>Quick tip:</em> in 2.5 you click the name of things to edit them, like your username to edit your profile or the title of a post to edit it.</p>\n<h3>The Community is Growing</h3>\n<p>More than growing, it&#8217;s on fire. We always talk about things like downloads, and the 2.3 branch has already had <strong>1.92 million downloads</strong> as I write this post, but this time we have some far more interesting information I&#8217;d like to share.</p>\n<p>There were over 1,200 commits to our repository since 2.3.0 and <strong>over 90 people were credited</strong> in them. This means in our core code, not plugins, there were at least 90 individual folks that contributed something high-quality enough that it made the cut to be part of the download you guys get today. I had no idea this group of people was so large.</p>\n<p>Outside of the <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/">core commit team</a>, there was particular help from these people, in rough order of number of credits and tickets: <a href="http://blogwaffe.com/">mdawaffe (Michael Adams)</a>, <a href="http://www.laptoptips.ca/">azaozz (Andrew Ozz)</a>, <a href="http://nb.niichavo.org/">nbachiyski (Nikolay Bachiyski)</a>, <a href="http://skeltoac.com/">andy (Andy Skelton)</a>, <a href="http://iammattthomas.com/">iammattthomas (Matt Thomas)</a>, <a href="http://thresholdstate.com/">tellyworth (Alex Shiels)</a>, <a href="http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/">josephscott (Joseph Scott)</a>, <a href="http://foolswisdom.com/">lloydbudd (Lloyd Budd)</a>, <a href="http://dd32.id.au/">DD32 (Dion)</a>, <a href="http://www.ilfilosofo.com/">filosofo (Austin Matzko)</a>, <a href="http://engel.uk.to/">hansengel (Hans Engel)</a>, <a href="http://www.freecharity.org.uk/">pishmishy</a>, ffemtcj, <a href="http://www.viper007bond.com/">Viper007Bond</a>, <a href="http://extralogical.net/">ionfish (Benedict Eastaugh)</a>, <a href="http://www.poplarware.com/">jhodgdon (Jennifer Hodgdon)</a>, <a href="http://ottodestruct.com/blog/">Otto42</a>, <a href="http://www.cefm.ca/">thee17 (Charles E. Free-Melvin)</a>, and <a href="http://www.buayacorp.com/">xknown</a>. Also want to thank MichaelH and Lorelle on the documentation side, and moshu, Kafkaesqui, whooami, MichaelH, Otto42, and jeremyclark13 for helping with support.</p>\n<p>The 2.5 branch is nicknamed &#8220;Brecker&#8221; in honor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Brecker">Michael Brecker</a>, an exceptionally talented saxophonist who could cross styles effortlessly and never stopped experimenting and pushing himself until he passed away last year.</p>\n<h3>New WordPress.org</h3>\n<p>All of this wasn&#8217;t enough, so in our copious spare time we decided to redesign WordPress.org to better match the aesthetics of the new dashboard and also to spruce up a few areas that needed lovin&#8217;. Some parts of the site, like the Codex, might show the old style for a day or two. We know, just give us a bit of time. Thanks to <a href="http://iammattthomas.com/">Matt Thomas</a> for his epic effort in designing and coding the new site.</p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s Next</h3>\n<p>As always with WordPress, we don&#8217;t claim any of these features to be perfect, or to be better than everyone else in the world, but they are done by and for the people and the one thing we do promise is that with every release we listen and do our best to improve. </p>\n<p>2.5 is a major milestone for WordPress not because it added dozens of user-requested features, but because it reaffirms that we&#8217;re as passionate about blogging as the day we started. Our community is too fierce to rest on its laurels &#8212; contrary to what pundits claim, blogging is far from &#8220;finished&#8221; and every improvement just whets our appetite for more. And more is coming.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a good thing WordPress doesn&#8217;t limit the length of posts, because this one would have hit it. If you made it this far, thanks for sharing a bit of your day with us. I sincerely hope this new version of WordPress helps you do what you love to do.</p>\n";}i:1;a:12:{s:5:"title";s:32:"Screencast and WordPress 2.5 RC2";s:4:"link";s:58:"http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-rc2/";s:8:"comments";s:67:"http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-rc2/#comments";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Wed, 26 Mar 2008 11:36:25 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:4:"Matt";}s:8:"category";s:11:"Development";s:4:"guid";s:39:"http://wordpress.org/development/?p=227";s:11:"description";s:334:"2.5 is coming along thanks to the fantastic feedback you guys provided on RC1 (over 580 pingbacks and counting), and we&#8217;re now ready to show you a bit more of a peek with a short screencast covering the new dashboard and uploader and Release Candidate 2.

Then WordPress 2.5 might be the release for you. It&#8217;s been in the oven for a while, and we&#8217;re finally ready to open the doors a bit to give you a taste.</p>\n<p>For the past few months, we’ve been working with our friends at Happy Cog &#8212; <a href="http://zeldman.com/">Jeffrey Zeldman</a>, <a href="http://jasonsantamaria.com/">Jason Santa Maria</a>, and <a href="http://bobulate.com/">Liz Danzico</a> &#8212; to redesign WordPress from the ground-up. The result is a new way of interacting with WordPress that will remain familiar to seasoned users while improving the experience for everyone. This isn’t just a fresh coat of paint &#8212; we’ve re-thought the look of WordPress, as well as how it’s organized so that you can forget about the software and focus on your own creative pursuits.</p>\n<p>Here are a few vignettes of what&#8217;s in store.</p>\n<h3>The Dashboard</h3>\n<p class="tutscreen"><img src="http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/03/dashboard-wide.png" alt="dashboard-wide.png" /></p>\n<p>The Dashboard’s most important role is to inform quickly and get you to where you’re headed in the admin. In interviewing users, we found that most of you ignore the Dashboard entirely &#8212; its useful information being mostly hidden in an overly complex design. The new Dashboard is focused on the most relevant tasks at hand: a quick summary of what’s published and scheduled for publication, the latest comments and incoming links, blog stats, and WordPress updates and news. You can add your own RSS feeds and edit the way information is presented so that the new Dashboard conforms to the way you use WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Navigation</h3>\n<p class="tutscreen"><img src="http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/03/nav-wide.png" alt="nav-wide.png" /></p>\n<p>The WordPress navigation has confounded even sophisticated users. With the new design, we’ve cut the number of navigation options in half, separating the primary functions (writing, managing posts and pages, editing the blog’s design, and managing comments) from secondary functions. This presents information at a more comfortable pace, revealing only the information that’s necessary. Everything you need is still there &#8212; just better organized. (Especially for people new to WP.)</p>\n<h3>Write</h3>\n<p class="tutscreen"><img src="http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/03/write-wide.png" alt="write-wide.png" /></p>\n<p><img class="right" src="http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/03/write3.png" alt="write2.png" /></p>\n<p>By far, the most frequently accessed part of WordPress is the Write screen. It gets the job done, but its myriad options can be overwhelming. The new write screen only displays the information that you’ll use most often. It displays the most common fields in a way that makes posting incredibly easy. Additional options are hidden away until you need them. The new Write screen anticipates the natural flow of the way you write, and is smart enough to remember the way you left it so that your preferred writing environment is always quickly available. The new visual editor even has a handy full-screen mode to help block out distractions while composing your newest post. (My personal favorite new feature.)</p>\n<h3>Manage</h3>\n<p class="tutscreen"><img src="http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/03/manage-wide.png" alt="" /></p>\n<p><img class="right" src="http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/03/manage.png" alt="" /></p>\n<p>The Manage screens have been redesigned and unified so that now, managing your pages, posts, media, and comments all use similar, consistent interfaces. We’ve omitted superfluous information and made what’s important faster to find. We believe these changes will make you a faster, more proficient blogger.</p>\n<p>You might also notice there are some new colors, the dashboard feels much fresher and lighter. If you&#8217;re jonesing for the old look under your user options you can now select the &#8220;classic&#8221; colors and get those old blues back. (It&#8217;s also pluggable so people can easily add or share their own color schemes.)</p>\n<p>If you make frequent backups and you&#8217;re interested in helping us out with development by testing the new code, <a href="http://wordpress.org/wordpress-2.5-RC1.zip">download</a> and install <a href="http://wordpress.org/wordpress-2.5-RC1.zip">Release Candidate 1</a> of WordPress 2.5, and <a href="http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-testers">join our testers mailing list</a> to report any bugs you find in the code.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re also interested in feedback on the new interface and would love to hear your opinions, thoughts, rants, raves, and anything in between. We created a special email address just for the occasion: <a href="mailto:2.5-feedback@wordpress.org">2.5-feedback@wordpress.org</a>.</p>\n<p>The software is basically done and stable, and could be released today, but we&#8217;d like to incorporate feedback from a wider audience before making it available to the general public. After a few days of your feedback we&#8217;ll set a final release date. Personally, I can&#8217;t wait. <img src=''http://wordpress.org/development/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif'' alt='':)'' class=''wp-smiley'' /></p>\n";}s:3:"wfw";a:1:{s:10:"commentrss";s:60:"http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/25-sneak-peek/feed/";}s:7:"summary";s:360:"A customizable dashboard, multi-file upload, built-in galleries, one-click plugin upgrades, tag management, built-in Gravatars, full text feeds, and faster load times sound interesting?

The new Dashboard is focused on the most relevant tasks at hand: a quick summary of what’s published and scheduled for publication, the latest comments and incoming links, blog stats, and WordPress updates and news. You can add your own RSS feeds and edit the way information is presented so that the new Dashboard conforms to the way you use WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Navigation</h3>\n<p class="tutscreen"><img src="http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/03/nav-wide.png" alt="nav-wide.png" /></p>\n<p>The WordPress navigation has confounded even sophisticated users. With the new design, we’ve cut the number of navigation options in half, separating the primary functions (writing, managing posts and pages, editing the blog’s design, and managing comments) from secondary functions. This presents information at a more comfortable pace, revealing only the information that’s necessary. Everything you need is still there &#8212; just better organized. (Especially for people new to WP.)</p>\n<h3>Write</h3>\n<p class="tutscreen"><img src="http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/03/write-wide.png" alt="write-wide.png" /></p>\n<p><img class="right" src="http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/03/write3.png" alt="write2.png" /></p>\n<p>By far, the most frequently accessed part of WordPress is the Write screen. It gets the job done, but its myriad options can be overwhelming. The new write screen only displays the information that you’ll use most often. It displays the most common fields in a way that makes posting incredibly easy. Additional options are hidden away until you need them. The new Write screen anticipates the natural flow of the way you write, and is smart enough to remember the way you left it so that your preferred writing environment is always quickly available. The new visual editor even has a handy full-screen mode to help block out distractions while composing your newest post. (My personal favorite new feature.)</p>\n<h3>Manage</h3>\n<p class="tutscreen"><img src="http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/03/manage-wide.png" alt="" /></p>\n<p><img class="right" src="http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/03/manage.png" alt="" /></p>\n<p>The Manage screens have been redesigned and unified so that now, managing your pages, posts, media, and comments all use similar, consistent interfaces. We’ve omitted superfluous information and made what’s important faster to find. We believe these changes will make you a faster, more proficient blogger.</p>\n<p>You might also notice there are some new colors, the dashboard feels much fresher and lighter. If you&#8217;re jonesing for the old look under your user options you can now select the &#8220;classic&#8221; colors and get those old blues back. (It&#8217;s also pluggable so people can easily add or share their own color schemes.)</p>\n<p>If you make frequent backups and you&#8217;re interested in helping us out with development by testing the new code, <a href="http://wordpress.org/wordpress-2.5-RC1.zip">download</a> and install <a href="http://wordpress.org/wordpress-2.5-RC1.zip">Release Candidate 1</a> of WordPress 2.5, and <a href="http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-testers">join our testers mailing list</a> to report any bugs you find in the code.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re also interested in feedback on the new interface and would love to hear your opinions, thoughts, rants, raves, and anything in between. We created a special email address just for the occasion: <a href="mailto:2.5-feedback@wordpress.org">2.5-feedback@wordpress.org</a>.</p>\n<p>The software is basically done and stable, and could be released today, but we&#8217;d like to incorporate feedback from a wider audience before making it available to the general public. After a few days of your feedback we&#8217;ll set a final release date. Personally, I can&#8217;t wait. <img src=''http://wordpress.org/development/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif'' alt='':)'' class=''wp-smiley'' /></p>\n";}i:3;a:12:{s:5:"title";s:15:"WordPress 2.3.3";s:4:"link";s:55:"http://wordpress.org/development/2008/02/wordpress-233/";s:8:"comments";s:64:"http://wordpress.org/development/2008/02/wordpress-233/#comments";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Tue, 05 Feb 2008 05:02:45 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:4:"Ryan";}s:8:"category";s:11:"Development";s:4:"guid";s:39:"http://wordpress.org/development/?p=225";s:11:"description";s:307:"WordPress 2.3.3 is an urgent security release.

We&#8217;ve included importers for the Ultimate Tag Warrior, Jerome&#8217;s Keywords, Simple Tags, and Bunny&#8217;s Technorati Tag plugins so if you&#8217;ve already been using a tagging plugin you can bring your data into the new system. The tagging system is also wicked-fast, so your host won&#8217;t mind.</li>\n<li>Our new <strong>update notification</strong> lets you know when there is a new release of WordPress or when any of the plugins you use has an update available. It works by sending your blog URL, plugins, and version information to our new <code>api.wordpress.org</code> service which then compares it to the plugin database and tells you whats the latest and greatest you can use.</li>\n<li>We&#8217;ve cleaned up URLs a bunch in a feature we call <strong>canonical URLs</strong> which does things like enforce your no-www preference, redirect posts with changed slugs so a link never goes bad, redirect URLs that get cut off in emails on similar to the correct post, and much more. This helps your users, and it also <strong>helps your search engine optimization</strong>, as search engines like for each page to be available in one <a href="http://www.answers.com/canonical?cat=technology">canonical</a> location. <a href="http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2007/09/25/wordpress-23-canonical-urls/">More info here</a>.</li>\n<li>Our new <strong>pending review</strong> feature will be great for multi-author blogs. It allows authors to submit a post for review by an editor or administrator, where before they would just have to save a draft and hope someone noticed it.</li>\n<li>There is new <strong>advanced WYSIWYG</strong> functionality (we call it the kitchen sink button) that allows you to access some features of TinyMCE that were previously hidden.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You&#8217;ll notice that two of those features are straight out of the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/?show=popular">most-voted for ideas list</a>.

Funnily because I kept the edit screen for the announcement open from stage the concurrent editing protection prevented anyone else fom publishing the post! <a href="http://skeltoac.com/">Andy</a> told me after I was done and I pushed the button, but it&#8217;s good to know the feature works. <img src="http://ma.tt/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>";}i:3;a:7:{s:5:"title";s:39:"Peter Westwood: WordPress 2.5 in detail";s:4:"guid";s:32:"http://westi.wordpress.com/?p=47";s:4:"link";s:61:"http://westi.wordpress.com/2008/03/29/wordpress-25-in-detail/";s:11:"description";s:2621:"<div class="snap_preview"><br /><p><a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-brecker/">WordPress 2.5 has been released</a> and includes a huge number of changes over the WordPress 2.3 series.

The improvements in 2.5 are numerous, and almost entirely a result of your feedback: multi-file uploading, one-click plugin upgrades, built-in galleries, customizable dashboard, salted passwords and cookie encryption, media library, a WYSIWYG that doesn&#8217;t mess with your code, concurrent post editing protection, full-screen writing, and search that covers posts <em>and</em> pages.</p>\n<p>For a short overview of the features with screenshots, it&#8217;d be best to <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/25-sneak-peek/">visit our sneak peek announcement for RC1</a>. Or check out <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-rc2/">a 4-minute screencast of the new interface in action</a>. If you just want to jump straight to the good stuff <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">here&#8217;s where you can find 2.5 upgrade and download information</a>.</p>\n<p>If you want to see everything I would grab a cup of coffee or a mojito, because this post is epic.</p>\n<h3>User Features</h3>\n<p><strong>Cleaner, faster, less cluttered dashboard</strong> &#8212; we&#8217;ve worked hard to take your feedback about what&#8217;s most important in the dashboard and organize things to allow you to focus on what&#8217;s important &#8212; your blog &#8212; and get out of your way. In collaboration with <a href="http://happycog.com/">Happy Cog</a> and the community  we&#8217;ve taken the first major step forward in the WordPress interface since version 1.5.</p>\n<p><strong>Dashboard Widgets</strong> &#8212; the dashboard home page is now a series of widgets, including ones to show you fun stats about your posting, latest comments, people linking to you, new and popular plugins, and of course WordPress news. You can customize any of the dashboard widgets to show, for example, news from your local paper instead of WP news. Plugins can also hook in, for example the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/stats/">WordPress.com stats widget</a> adds a handy double-wide stats box.</p>\n<p><img src="http://s.wordpress.org/screenshots/2.5/stats-widget.png" alt="" width="690" /></p>\n<p><strong>Multi-file upload with progress bar</strong> &#8212; before when you would upload a large file you&#8217;d wait forever, never knowing how far along it was. And uploading more than one photo was an exercise in patience, as you could only do one at a time. Now you can select a whole of folder images or music or videos at once and it&#8217;ll show you the progress of each upload.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus: EXIF extraction</strong> &#8212; if you upload JPEG files with EXIF metadata like camera make and model, aperture, shutter speed, ISO, et al. WordPress will extract all the data into custom fields you can use in your template. If you use the EXIF title fields or similar those will be put into their equivalent fields in WP. Most modern digital cameras generate EXIF data.</p>\n<p><strong>Search posts and pages</strong> &#8212; search used to cover just posts, now it includes pages too, a great boon for thoe using WordPress as a CMS. New themes can style or sort pages differently in results.</p>\n<p><strong>Tag management</strong> &#8212; you can now add, rename, delete, and do whatever else you like to tags from inside WordPress, no plugins needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Password strength meter</strong> &#8212; when you change your password on your profile it&#8217;ll tell you how strong your password is to help you pick a good one.</p>\n<p><strong>Concurrent editing protection</strong> &#8212; for those of you on multi-author blogs, have you ever opened a post while someone was already editing it, and your auto-saves kept overwriting each other, irrecoverably losing hours of work? I bet that added a few words to your vocabulary. Now if you open a post that someone else is editing, WordPress magically locks it and prevents you from saving until the other person is done. You&#8217;ll see a message like below.</p>\n<p><img src="http://s.wordpress.org/screenshots/2.5/write-currently-editing.png" alt="" /></p>\n<p><strong>Few-click plugin upgrades</strong> &#8212; if the plugins you use are part of the plugin directory since 2.3 we&#8217;ve told you when they have an update available. Now we take that to the next logical step &#8212; downloading and installing the upgrade for you. This is dependent a little bit on your host setup, and it may ask you for your FTP password much like OS X or Windows will ask you for a password, but it works well on majority of hosts we were able to test, your mileage may very, plugins in mirror may be larger than they appear.</p>\n<p><strong>Friendlier visual post editor</strong> &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure how to articulate this improvement except to say &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t mess with your code anymore.&#8221; We&#8217;re now using version 3.0 of TinyMCE, which means better compatibility with Safari, and we&#8217;ve paid particular attention this release to its integration and interaction with complex HTML. It also now has a &#8220;no-distractions&#8221; mode which is like Writeroom for your browser.</p>\n<p><strong>Built-in galleries</strong> &#8212; when you take advantage of multi-file upload to upload a bunch of photos, we have a new shortcode that lets you to easily embed galleries by just putting [ gallery] (without the space) in your post. It&#8217;ll display all your thumbnails and captions and each will link each to a page where people can comment on the individual photos. I&#8217;ve been using this feature on my blog and have already uploaded over <a href="http://ma.tt/category/gallery/">1,200 pictures into 23 galleries</a>. The shortcode has some hidden options too, <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_the_gallery_shortcode">check out this documentation</a>.</p>\n<h3>Developer Features</h3>\n<p>Now for the geeky stuff. While we&#8217;re excited about the above features, each one represents a new opportunity or API for other developers to take to another level. (The best of which we&#8217;ll someday integrate back into WP.)</p>\n<p><strong>Salted passwords</strong> &#8212; we now use the <a href="http://www.openwall.com/phpass/">phpass</a> library to stretch and salt all passwords stored in the database, which makes brute-forcing them impractical. If you use something like <a href="http://modauthmysql.sourceforge.net/">mod_auth_mysql</a> we&#8217;ve <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/md5-password-hashes/">created a plugin that will allow you to use legacy MD5 hashing</a>. (The hashing is completely pluggable.) Users will automatically switch to the more secure passwords next time they log in.</p>\n<p><strong>Secure cookies</strong> &#8212; cookies are now encrypted based on the protocol described <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~alexliu/publications/Cookie/cookie.pdf">in this PDF paper</a>. which is something like <code>user name|expiration time|HMAC( user name|expiration time, k)</code> where <code>k = HMAC(user name|expiration time, sk)</code> and where <code>sk</code> is a secret key, which you can define in your config.</p>\n<p><strong>Easy taxonomy and URL creation</strong> &#8212; probably best illustrated with an example: I can call <code>register_taxonomy()</code> with <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/6357/taxes.php">a few arguments</a> to register a &#8220;people&#8221; taxonomy and whenever I edit an image I&#8217;ll see a UI like tags has for identifying the people in a photo, and these will be URL addressable with <code>/person/firstname-lastname/</code>. All with a single function call.</p>\n<p><strong>Inline documentation</strong> &#8212; the vast majority of the new code going into WordPress include inline documentation that explains the functions and documents their arguments.</p>\n<p><strong>Database optimization</strong> &#8212; we haven&#8217;t changed the table layout in this release, which is one of the reasons so many plugins work fine with 2.5. We have added a few new indicies and made a few default fields more flexible based on some bottlenecks we found on WordPress.com, which now hosts 2.7 million WordPress blogs. It should be invisible to the application, just a bit faster on the database side.</p>\n<p><strong>$wpdb->prepare()</strong> &#8212; now almost all of the SQL in WordPress is prepared first, and the same functions are available to your plugins. This should prevent elementary SQL escaping issues.</p>\n<p><strong>Media buttons</strong> &#8212; the add media buttons above the post are both expandable, so you could have an &#8220;Add Google Map&#8221; button if you like, They can be overridden, so if you think you can do the video or audio tab better than we have you can replace the default.</p>\n<p><strong>Shortcode API</strong> &#8212; the new gallery functionality is powered by the new shortcode API. Shortcodes are little bracket-delineated strings that can be magically expanded at runtime to something more interesting. They give users a short, easy to type and copy/paste string they can move around their post without worrying about messing up complex HTML or embed codes. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API">The Shortcode API is fully documented</a>.</p>\n<p>Now you see why 2.5 took a little extra time. <img src="http://wordpress.org/development/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>\n<h3>Upgrade Notes</h3>\n<p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress">The upgrade instructions for this version are pretty much the same as any other version</a>. The most important thing to check is your plugins, so if for example everything works except the new uploader, a legacy plugin might be causing a javascript error on the page and breaking it. If something goes wrong, the safest thing to do is turn your plugins off (we have a button to do them all at once, now) and turn them back on one-by-one, testing the problem along the way. This has solved almost everybody&#8217;s problems in testing, and it also lets you know which plugin author to show some love to so they&#8217;ll update their plugin, and which plugin authors already have so you can shower them with praises on your blog.</p>\n<p>One brief note about some of the new upload and plugin upgrade features, there are some edge-case hosting platforms, like versions of Lighttpd before 1.5 or over-agressive mod_security rules, which can break. If something isn&#8217;t working like it was looked in the screenshot, ask your host if there&#8217;s something on the server side which may be interfering. Hosts, feel free to join and post to <a href="http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-testers">our wp-testers mailing list</a> if you have an environment that requires some extra code to work around. We&#8217;d be happy to include it in the next update.</p>\n<p><em>Quick tip:</em> in 2.5 you click the name of things to edit them, like your username to edit your profile or the title of a post to edit it.</p>\n<h3>The Community is Growing</h3>\n<p>More than growing, it&#8217;s on fire. We always talk about things like downloads, and the 2.3 branch has already had <strong>1.92 million downloads</strong> as I write this post, but this time we have some far more interesting information I&#8217;d like to share.</p>\n<p>There were over 1,200 commits to our repository since 2.3.0 and <strong>over 90 people were credited</strong> in them. This means in our core code, not plugins, there were at least 90 individual folks that contributed something high-quality enough that it made the cut to be part of the download you guys get today.

The improvements in 2.5 are numerous, and almost entirely a result of your feedback: multi-file uploading, one-click plugin upgrades, built-in galleries, customizable dashboard, salted passwords and cookie encryption, media library, a WYSIWYG that doesn&#8217;t mess with your code, concurrent post editing protection, full-screen writing, and search that covers posts <em>and</em> pages.</p>\n<p>For a short overview of the features with screenshots, it&#8217;d be best to <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/25-sneak-peek/">visit our sneak peek announcement for RC1</a>. Or check out <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-rc2/">a 4-minute screencast of the new interface in action</a>. If you just want to jump straight to the good stuff <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">here&#8217;s where you can find 2.5 upgrade and download information</a>.</p>\n<p>If you want to see everything I would grab a cup of coffee or a mojito, because this post is epic.</p>\n<h3>User Features</h3>\n<p><strong>Cleaner, faster, less cluttered dashboard</strong> &#8212; we&#8217;ve worked hard to take your feedback about what&#8217;s most important in the dashboard and organize things to allow you to focus on what&#8217;s important &#8212; your blog &#8212; and get out of your way. In collaboration with <a href="http://happycog.com/">Happy Cog</a> and the community  we&#8217;ve taken the first major step forward in the WordPress interface since version 1.5.</p>\n<p><strong>Dashboard Widgets</strong> &#8212; the dashboard home page is now a series of widgets, including ones to show you fun stats about your posting, latest comments, people linking to you, new and popular plugins, and of course WordPress news. You can customize any of the dashboard widgets to show, for example, news from your local paper instead of WP news. Plugins can also hook in, for example the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/stats/">WordPress.com stats widget</a> adds a handy double-wide stats box.</p>\n<p><img src="http://s.wordpress.org/screenshots/2.5/stats-widget.png" alt="" width="690" /></p>\n<p><strong>Multi-file upload with progress bar</strong> &#8212; before when you would upload a large file you&#8217;d wait forever, never knowing how far along it was. And uploading more than one photo was an exercise in patience, as you could only do one at a time. Now you can select a whole of folder images or music or videos at once and it&#8217;ll show you the progress of each upload.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus: EXIF extraction</strong> &#8212; if you upload JPEG files with EXIF metadata like camera make and model, aperture, shutter speed, ISO, et al. WordPress will extract all the data into custom fields you can use in your template. If you use the EXIF title fields or similar those will be put into their equivalent fields in WP. Most modern digital cameras generate EXIF data.</p>\n<p><strong>Search posts and pages</strong> &#8212; search used to cover just posts, now it includes pages too, a great boon for thoe using WordPress as a CMS. New themes can style or sort pages differently in results.</p>\n<p><strong>Tag management</strong> &#8212; you can now add, rename, delete, and do whatever else you like to tags from inside WordPress, no plugins needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Password strength meter</strong> &#8212; when you change your password on your profile it&#8217;ll tell you how strong your password is to help you pick a good one.</p>\n<p><strong>Concurrent editing protection</strong> &#8212; for those of you on multi-author blogs, have you ever opened a post while someone was already editing it, and your auto-saves kept overwriting each other, irrecoverably losing hours of work? I bet that added a few words to your vocabulary. Now if you open a post that someone else is editing, WordPress magically locks it and prevents you from saving until the other person is done. You&#8217;ll see a message like below.</p>\n<p><img src="http://s.wordpress.org/screenshots/2.5/write-currently-editing.png" alt="" /></p>\n<p><strong>Few-click plugin upgrades</strong> &#8212; if the plugins you use are part of the plugin directory since 2.3 we&#8217;ve told you when they have an update available. Now we take that to the next logical step &#8212; downloading and installing the upgrade for you. This is dependent a little bit on your host setup, and it may ask you for your FTP password much like OS X or Windows will ask you for a password, but it works well on majority of hosts we were able to test, your mileage may very, plugins in mirror may be larger than they appear.</p>\n<p><strong>Friendlier visual post editor</strong> &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure how to articulate this improvement except to say &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t mess with your code anymore.&#8221; We&#8217;re now using version 3.0 of TinyMCE, which means better compatibility with Safari, and we&#8217;ve paid particular attention this release to its integration and interaction with complex HTML. It also now has a &#8220;no-distractions&#8221; mode which is like Writeroom for your browser.</p>\n<p><strong>Built-in galleries</strong> &#8212; when you take advantage of multi-file upload to upload a bunch of photos, we have a new shortcode that lets you to easily embed galleries by just putting [ gallery] (without the space) in your post. It&#8217;ll display all your thumbnails and captions and each will link each to a page where people can comment on the individual photos. I&#8217;ve been using this feature on my blog and have already uploaded over <a href="http://ma.tt/category/gallery/">1,200 pictures into 23 galleries</a>. The shortcode has some hidden options too, <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_the_gallery_shortcode">check out this documentation</a>.</p>\n<h3>Developer Features</h3>\n<p>Now for the geeky stuff. While we&#8217;re excited about the above features, each one represents a new opportunity or API for other developers to take to another level. (The best of which we&#8217;ll someday integrate back into WP.)</p>\n<p><strong>Salted passwords</strong> &#8212; we now use the <a href="http://www.openwall.com/phpass/">phpass</a> library to stretch and salt all passwords stored in the database, which makes brute-forcing them impractical. If you use something like <a href="http://modauthmysql.sourceforge.net/">mod_auth_mysql</a> we&#8217;ve <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/md5-password-hashes/">created a plugin that will allow you to use legacy MD5 hashing</a>. (The hashing is completely pluggable.) Users will automatically switch to the more secure passwords next time they log in.</p>\n<p><strong>Secure cookies</strong> &#8212; cookies are now encrypted based on the protocol described <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~alexliu/publications/Cookie/cookie.pdf">in this PDF paper</a>. which is something like <code>user name|expiration time|HMAC( user name|expiration time, k)</code> where <code>k = HMAC(user name|expiration time, sk)</code> and where <code>sk</code> is a secret key, which you can define in your config.</p>\n<p><strong>Easy taxonomy and URL creation</strong> &#8212; probably best illustrated with an example: I can call <code>register_taxonomy()</code> with <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/6357/taxes.php">a few arguments</a> to register a &#8220;people&#8221; taxonomy and whenever I edit an image I&#8217;ll see a UI like tags has for identifying the people in a photo, and these will be URL addressable with <code>/person/firstname-lastname/</code>. All with a single function call.</p>\n<p><strong>Inline documentation</strong> &#8212; the vast majority of the new code going into WordPress include inline documentation that explains the functions and documents their arguments.</p>\n<p><strong>Database optimization</strong> &#8212; we haven&#8217;t changed the table layout in this release, which is one of the reasons so many plugins work fine with 2.5. We have added a few new indicies and made a few default fields more flexible based on some bottlenecks we found on WordPress.com, which now hosts 2.7 million WordPress blogs. It should be invisible to the application, just a bit faster on the database side.</p>\n<p><strong>$wpdb->prepare()</strong> &#8212; now almost all of the SQL in WordPress is prepared first, and the same functions are available to your plugins. This should prevent elementary SQL escaping issues.</p>\n<p><strong>Media buttons</strong> &#8212; the add media buttons above the post are both expandable, so you could have an &#8220;Add Google Map&#8221; button if you like, They can be overridden, so if you think you can do the video or audio tab better than we have you can replace the default.</p>\n<p><strong>Shortcode API</strong> &#8212; the new gallery functionality is powered by the new shortcode API. Shortcodes are little bracket-delineated strings that can be magically expanded at runtime to something more interesting. They give users a short, easy to type and copy/paste string they can move around their post without worrying about messing up complex HTML or embed codes. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API">The Shortcode API is fully documented</a>.</p>\n<p>Now you see why 2.5 took a little extra time. <img src="http://wordpress.org/development/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>\n<h3>Upgrade Notes</h3>\n<p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress">The upgrade instructions for this version are pretty much the same as any other version</a>. The most important thing to check is your plugins, so if for example everything works except the new uploader, a legacy plugin might be causing a javascript error on the page and breaking it. If something goes wrong, the safest thing to do is turn your plugins off (we have a button to do them all at once, now) and turn them back on one-by-one, testing the problem along the way. This has solved almost everybody&#8217;s problems in testing, and it also lets you know which plugin author to show some love to so they&#8217;ll update their plugin, and which plugin authors already have so you can shower them with praises on your blog.</p>\n<p>One brief note about some of the new upload and plugin upgrade features, there are some edge-case hosting platforms, like versions of Lighttpd before 1.5 or over-agressive mod_security rules, which can break. If something isn&#8217;t working like it was looked in the screenshot, ask your host if there&#8217;s something on the server side which may be interfering. Hosts, feel free to join and post to <a href="http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-testers">our wp-testers mailing list</a> if you have an environment that requires some extra code to work around. We&#8217;d be happy to include it in the next update.</p>\n<p><em>Quick tip:</em> in 2.5 you click the name of things to edit them, like your username to edit your profile or the title of a post to edit it.</p>\n<h3>The Community is Growing</h3>\n<p>More than growing, it&#8217;s on fire. We always talk about things like downloads, and the 2.3 branch has already had <strong>1.92 million downloads</strong> as I write this post, but this time we have some far more interesting information I&#8217;d like to share.</p>\n<p>There were over 1,200 commits to our repository since 2.3.0 and <strong>over 90 people were credited</strong> in them. This means in our core code, not plugins, there were at least 90 individual folks that contributed something high-quality enough that it made the cut to be part of the download you guys get today. I had no idea this group of people was so large.</p>\n<p>Outside of the <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/">core commit team</a>, there was particular help from these people, in rough order of number of credits and tickets: <a href="http://blogwaffe.com/">mdawaffe (Michael Adams)</a>, <a href="http://www.laptoptips.ca/">azaozz (Andrew Ozz)</a>, <a href="http://nb.niichavo.org/">nbachiyski (Nikolay Bachiyski)</a>, <a href="http://skeltoac.com/">andy (Andy Skelton)</a>, <a href="http://iammattthomas.com/">iammattthomas (Matt Thomas)</a>, <a href="http://thresholdstate.com/">tellyworth (Alex Shiels)</a>, <a href="http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/">josephscott (Joseph Scott)</a>, <a href="http://foolswisdom.com/">lloydbudd (Lloyd Budd)</a>, <a href="http://dd32.id.au/">DD32 (Dion)</a>, <a href="http://www.ilfilosofo.com/">filosofo (Austin Matzko)</a>, <a href="http://engel.uk.to/">hansengel (Hans Engel)</a>, <a href="http://www.freecharity.org.uk/">pishmishy</a>, ffemtcj, <a href="http://www.viper007bond.com/">Viper007Bond</a>, <a href="http://extralogical.net/">ionfish (Benedict Eastaugh)</a>, <a href="http://www.poplarware.com/">jhodgdon (Jennifer Hodgdon)</a>, <a href="http://ottodestruct.com/blog/">Otto42</a>, <a href="http://www.cefm.ca/">thee17 (Charles E.

Not all plugins work nicely with others so be sure to read the installation manual if you decide to use any of these plugins on your own blog.</p>\n<p>1. <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cookies-for-comments/#post-4766" title="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cookies-for-comments/#post-4766" target="_blank"><strong>Comments For Cookies</strong></a> - This plugin adds a stylesheet to your blog&#8217;s html source code. When a browser loads that stylesheet a cookie is dropped. If that user then leaves a comment the cookie is checked. If it doesn&#8217;t exist the comment is marked as spam.</p>\n<p>2. <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bad-behavior/#post-30" title="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bad-behavior/#post-30" target="_blank"><strong>Bad Behavior</strong></a> - Bad Behavior is an awesome comment spam blocking plugin. If you can imagine, Bad Behavior is like Akismet on steroids. BH is a plugin which contains a series of scripts which block comment spam, trackback spam, guestbook spam, wiki spam, and even protects your site from some malicious website hacking. It&#8217;s been rumored that Akismet combined with Bad Behavior is the ultimate anti spam configuration in WordPress.</p>\n<p>3. <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-spamfree/#post-2654" title="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-spamfree/#post-2654" target="_blank"><strong>WP-SpamFree</strong></a> - SpamFree takes a somewhat different approach at combating spam by using a combination of JavaScript and cookies. According to the plugin author, most automated bots are stopped dead in their tracks by using this method while normal web site visitors are unaffected. However, the plugin author does state that there may be a few visitors who have JS and cookies disabled who might be annoyed by this plugin but that those people would be far fewer than the 100% of people which would be annoyed by CAPTCHA&#8217;s, challenge questions and other validation methods.</p>\n<p>4. <a href="http://wp-plugins.net/doc/sk2/" title="http://wp-plugins.net/doc/sk2/" target="_blank"><strong>Spam Karma 2</strong></a> - SK2 is the successor to SpamKarma. SpamKarma2 developed in 2007 is a an anti spam plugin which contains a wide assortment of options with the ability to find tune it&#8217;s effectiveness. SK2 even comes with it&#8217;s own module system where you can download separate modules and add functionality to the original plugin if the default is not enough for you. Despite this plugins age, WordPressers are still chanting about how well this plugin works.</p>\n<p>5. <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/comment-inbox/#post-4907" title="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/comment-inbox/#post-4907" target="_blank"><strong>Comment Inbox</strong></a> - Developed by Mark Jaquith, Comment Inbox gives you the ease of the moderation queue with the freedom of unmoderated comments. Comment Inbox works by placing all comments except caught spam into moderation which is renamed to Comment Inbox.

The first is a verification code which is always generated dynamically. The second is that each verification code is given a session id which is different from the PHPSESSID value. The third protection is that every session id and verification code gets their own time stamp. The time stamp works on the premise that humans need a few seconds or minutes to post a comment. The last protection involved IP addresses. The visitor&#8217;s IP is stored with the verification code and only when the comment contains the original IP it&#8217;s then saved and held for moderation.</p>\n<p>7. <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/defensio-anti-spam/#post-2597" title="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/defensio-anti-spam/#post-2597" target="_blank"><strong>Defensio Anti-Spam</strong></a> - This plugin is used by a number of WordPress bloggers. It works similarly in the same way as Akismet as it is an advanced, spam filtering service that learns and adapts to your behaviors and those of your readers. Defensio also includes support for OpenID, detailed statistics and more. With all of this functionality under the hood, it&#8217;s no wonder that this is one of the most popular anti spam plugins in use today, outside of Akismet.</p>\n<p>8. <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/worst-offenders/#post-4830" title="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/worst-offenders/#post-4830" target="_blank"><strong>Worst Offenders</strong></a> - Worst Offenders is a plugin that you can use to help decrease the amount of time you spend looking through messages to determine if they are spam or not. Worst Offenders analyzies messages already marked as spam and then uses several techniques to identify messages with common sources, subjects, and content. The messages marked as Worst Offenders can then be deleted all at once, leaving only a handful of messages to sift through.</p>\n<p>9. <strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-captcha-free/#post-4718" title="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-captcha-free/#post-4718" target="_blank">WP Captcha-Free</a> </strong>- WP Captcha-Free blocks automated comment spam without resorting to CAPTCHAs. It does so by validating a hash based on time (and some other parameters) using AJAX when the form is posted. Comments posted via automated means will not have a hash or will have an expired hash and will be rejected. Unlike using a captcha, this does not place any burden on the commenter.</p>\n<p>10. <strong>Akismet</strong> - There is no way in which I am going to write about spam blocking plugins and not include Akismet. Current versions of WordPress come with <a href="http://www.akismet.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.akismet.com/">Akismet</a> installed by default. Akismet uses a unique algorithm combined with a community-created database to &#8220;learn&#8221; which comments are comment spam and which are legitimate.</p>\n<p>The default configuration for Akismet may not be enough for some. In my own experience, I&#8217;ve noticed that by check marking the configuration option to allow Akismet to automatically discard spam comments on posts that are older than a month has dramatically lowered the amount of spam in my moderation queue.</p>\n<p>As for myself, I am perfectly content with the performance I have received out of Akismet. However, I must note that some of the success tied into Akismet deals with the way I have configured commenting in general on my own personal blog. For example, for a comment to appear on my blog, a user must fill out the name and email text fields. They must also contain a previously approved comment. I have also configured my comment moderation settings to place comments in the moderation queue if they contain two or more links.</p>\n<p>Everyone&#8217;s comment spam/configuration circumstances are different, so be sure to experiment with different options or techniques to figure out which comment spam blocking recipe works for you. If you would like even more information on how to combat comment spam, check out <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Combating_Comment_Spam" title="http://codex.wordpress.org/Combating_Comment_Spam" target="_blank">this article on the Codex</a>.</p>";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Wed, 26 Mar 2008 12:39:09 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:10:"Jeffro2pt0";}s:7:"summary";s:8475:"<p>When I recently wrote a <a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/03/22/after-wordpress-is-installed/" title="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/03/22/after-wordpress-is-installed/" target="_blank">post</a> which pointed to an article that described a few things you should do with your WordPress blog immediately after having it installed, I noticed Collin made a comment in that, WordPress was like the Windows OS where as, it comes bundled with Internet Explorer for a browser while WordPress comes bundled with (albeit fantastic) Akismet for a comment spam blocker.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, here are 9 plugins that you can use either as stand alone replacements or in various combinations to combat comment spam. Not all plugins work nicely with others so be sure to read the installation manual if you decide to use any of these plugins on your own blog.</p>\n<p>1. <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cookies-for-comments/#post-4766" title="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cookies-for-comments/#post-4766" target="_blank"><strong>Comments For Cookies</strong></a> - This plugin adds a stylesheet to your blog&#8217;s html source code. When a browser loads that stylesheet a cookie is dropped. If that user then leaves a comment the cookie is checked. If it doesn&#8217;t exist the comment is marked as spam.</p>\n<p>2. <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bad-behavior/#post-30" title="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bad-behavior/#post-30" target="_blank"><strong>Bad Behavior</strong></a> - Bad Behavior is an awesome comment spam blocking plugin. If you can imagine, Bad Behavior is like Akismet on steroids. BH is a plugin which contains a series of scripts which block comment spam, trackback spam, guestbook spam, wiki spam, and even protects your site from some malicious website hacking. It&#8217;s been rumored that Akismet combined with Bad Behavior is the ultimate anti spam configuration in WordPress.</p>\n<p>3. <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-spamfree/#post-2654" title="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-spamfree/#post-2654" target="_blank"><strong>WP-SpamFree</strong></a> - SpamFree takes a somewhat different approach at combating spam by using a combination of JavaScript and cookies. According to the plugin author, most automated bots are stopped dead in their tracks by using this method while normal web site visitors are unaffected. However, the plugin author does state that there may be a few visitors who have JS and cookies disabled who might be annoyed by this plugin but that those people would be far fewer than the 100% of people which would be annoyed by CAPTCHA&#8217;s, challenge questions and other validation methods.</p>\n<p>4. <a href="http://wp-plugins.net/doc/sk2/" title="http://wp-plugins.net/doc/sk2/" target="_blank"><strong>Spam Karma 2</strong></a> - SK2 is the successor to SpamKarma. SpamKarma2 developed in 2007 is a an anti spam plugin which contains a wide assortment of options with the ability to find tune it&#8217;s effectiveness. SK2 even comes with it&#8217;s own module system where you can download separate modules and add functionality to the original plugin if the default is not enough for you. Despite this plugins age, WordPressers are still chanting about how well this plugin works.</p>\n<p>5. <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/comment-inbox/#post-4907" title="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/comment-inbox/#post-4907" target="_blank"><strong>Comment Inbox</strong></a> - Developed by Mark Jaquith, Comment Inbox gives you the ease of the moderation queue with the freedom of unmoderated comments. Comment Inbox works by placing all comments except caught spam into moderation which is renamed to Comment Inbox. All comments in the Comment Inbox will show up immediately on your blog so conversations don&#8217;t become interrupted by moderation time lines. An effective way of dealing with both spam and bacn on your blog.</p>\n<p>6. <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/captcha-godfather/#post-4871" title="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/captcha-godfather/#post-4871" target="_blank"><strong>CAPTCHA-Godfather</strong></a> - This plugin offers four different methods of protectio.

I had some lofty goals (admittedly some of them were borderline unachievable), but my main goal was this: make comment management more like managing a Gmail inbox.  There are typically four actions you can perform on a message in your Gmail inbox (other than reading it, that is): reply, archive, mark as spam, delete.  And &#8220;reply&#8221; is sort of diversion, so let&#8217;s make that three actions: archive, mark as spam, delete.  The great thing is that if you do it right, at the end, you&#8217;re left with an empty inbox, and <strong>you know all your open loops have been addressed</strong>.  It&#8217;s a good feeling, and it lets you know that the next time you dive into your inbox, you&#8217;re starting where you left off.</p>\n<p>With WordPress comment management, it was more like jumping on a passing train of infinite length, and trying to deal with all of the passengers on board, without knowing which passengers have been dealt with (do you walk towards the caboose or the engine!?).  When you&#8217;re done, you jump off, land on a cactus, and probably don&#8217;t feel like doing it again.</p>\n<p>So my goal was to move away from the infinite train of confusion and more to the zen-like GTD tranquility of the Gmail inbox.  <a href="http://www.bobulate.com/">Liz Danzico</a> from Happy Cog alluded to a similar goal at WordCamp SF 2007.  Although the Happy Cog redesign of the comment management screens is worlds better, it didn&#8217;t fundamentally address the speeding train issue.  And to be honest, I&#8217;ve been stuck on the problem for months.  I couldn&#8217;t think of an implementation that wouldn&#8217;t be a massively disruptive (and risky) overhaul&#8230; until tonight &#8212; kept awake by SXSW-inflicted cough and sore throat that refuse to die, I had my epiphany.  <strong>The solution is already here.</strong>  I&#8217;ve been searching for something that WordPress already does.</p>\n<p>Drumroll please.  The solution is: <strong>the comment moderation panel</strong>.  Full stop.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve noticed that <a href="http://ma.tt/">Matt Mullenweg</a> hasn&#8217;t quite been as dissatisfied with comment management as I have, and there&#8217;s a simple reason: he approves every comment that appears on his blog, whereas I deal with the comments after the fact.</p>\n<p>Now I know what you&#8217;re thinking&#8230; <strong>but what if I don&#8217;t want to have to approve comments before they appear on my blog?</strong>  Simple: tweak your blog to publicly show unapproved comments!  Now there are three comment statuses in WordPress: approved (1), unapproved (0), and spam.  With my proposed system those can be virtually &#8220;rethought&#8221; as: seen (1), unseen (0) and spam.

I had some lofty goals (admittedly some of them were borderline unachievable), but my main goal was this: make comment management more like managing a Gmail inbox.  There are typically four actions you can perform on a message in your Gmail inbox (other than reading it, that is): reply, archive, mark as spam, delete.  And &#8220;reply&#8221; is sort of diversion, so let&#8217;s make that three actions: archive, mark as spam, delete.  The great thing is that if you do it right, at the end, you&#8217;re left with an empty inbox, and <strong>you know all your open loops have been addressed</strong>.  It&#8217;s a good feeling, and it lets you know that the next time you dive into your inbox, you&#8217;re starting where you left off.</p>\n<p>With WordPress comment management, it was more like jumping on a passing train of infinite length, and trying to deal with all of the passengers on board, without knowing which passengers have been dealt with (do you walk towards the caboose or the engine!?).  When you&#8217;re done, you jump off, land on a cactus, and probably don&#8217;t feel like doing it again.</p>\n<p>So my goal was to move away from the infinite train of confusion and more to the zen-like GTD tranquility of the Gmail inbox.  <a href="http://www.bobulate.com/">Liz Danzico</a> from Happy Cog alluded to a similar goal at WordCamp SF 2007.  Although the Happy Cog redesign of the comment management screens is worlds better, it didn&#8217;t fundamentally address the speeding train issue.  And to be honest, I&#8217;ve been stuck on the problem for months.  I couldn&#8217;t think of an implementation that wouldn&#8217;t be a massively disruptive (and risky) overhaul&#8230; until tonight &#8212; kept awake by SXSW-inflicted cough and sore throat that refuse to die, I had my epiphany.  <strong>The solution is already here.</strong>  I&#8217;ve been searching for something that WordPress already does.</p>\n<p>Drumroll please.  The solution is: <strong>the comment moderation panel</strong>.  Full stop.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve noticed that <a href="http://ma.tt/">Matt Mullenweg</a> hasn&#8217;t quite been as dissatisfied with comment management as I have, and there&#8217;s a simple reason: he approves every comment that appears on his blog, whereas I deal with the comments after the fact.</p>\n<p>Now I know what you&#8217;re thinking&#8230; <strong>but what if I don&#8217;t want to have to approve comments before they appear on my blog?</strong>  Simple: tweak your blog to publicly show unapproved comments!  Now there are three comment statuses in WordPress: approved (1), unapproved (0), and spam.  With my proposed system those can be virtually &#8220;rethought&#8221; as: seen (1), unseen (0) and spam.  Both &#8220;seen&#8221; and &#8220;unseen&#8221; comments would show on the blog immediately, but &#8220;unseen&#8221; comments would show up in the moderation queue (which, thanks to the Happy Cog redesign, shows its contents in a colorful comment bubble on every WordPress admin page).

Even those testing WordPress for development and bug fixing purposes test it on test blogs, and rarely risk their main sites during the development stage. </p>\n<p><img src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2006/08/sig.gif" alt="" /><br />\n<hr />\n<p><font size="-1"><b>Site Search Tags:</b> <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=wordpress+tips" rel="tag">wordpress tips</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=wordpress+news" rel="tag">wordpress news</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=wordpress+2.5" rel="tag">wordpress 2.5</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=wordpress+release" rel="tag">wordpress release</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=wordpress+plugins" rel="tag">wordpress plugins</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=automatic+plugin+upgrade" rel="tag">automatic plugin upgrade</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=upgrade+plugins" rel="tag">upgrade plugins</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=plugin+upgrades" rel="tag">plugin upgrades</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=wordpress+bugs" rel="tag">wordpress bugs</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=wordpress+development" rel="tag">wordpress development</a> </p>\n<p><a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/feed/" title="Feed on Lorelle on WordPress"><img class="wp-smiley" src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2007/02/rss.png" alt="Feed on Lorelle on WordPress" /></a> <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/feed/" title="Feed on Lorelle on WordPress">Subscribe</a>  <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/LorelleOnWordpress" title="Feedburner Lorelle on WordPress Feed"><img class="wp-smiley" src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2007/04/feedburnericon.gif" alt="Feedburner icon" />Via Feedburner</a>  <a href="http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=182399" title="Lorelle on WordPress - full site feed email subscription"><img class="wp-smiley" src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2007/03/email.gif" alt="" />Subscribe by Email</a> <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/" title="Visit Lorelle on WordPress"><img class="wp-smiley" src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/pointer.gif" alt="" />Visit</a><br /><a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/about/" title="Copyright Protected by Brent and Lorelle VanFossen">Copyright Lorelle VanFossen</a>, the author of <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/books/blogging-tips/" title="Blogging Tips Book By Lorelle VanFossen"><em>Blogging Tips, What Bloggers Won''t Tell You About Blogging</em></a>.</font></p>\n<img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/categories/lorelle.wordpress.com/2427/" /> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/tags/lorelle.wordpress.com/2427/" /> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/lorelle.wordpress.com/2427/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/lorelle.wordpress.com/2427/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/lorelle.wordpress.com/2427/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/lorelle.wordpress.com/2427/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/lorelle.wordpress.com/2427/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/lorelle.wordpress.com/2427/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/lorelle.wordpress.com/2427/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/lorelle.wordpress.com/2427/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/lorelle.wordpress.com/2427/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/lorelle.wordpress.com/2427/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=lorelle.wordpress.com&blog=72&post=2427&subd=lorelle&ref=&feed=1" /></div>";}i:41;a:7:{s:5:"title";s:51:"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress 2.5 RC1 Released";s:4:"guid";s:79:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/03/18/wordpress-25-rc1-released/";s:4:"link";s:79:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/03/18/wordpress-25-rc1-released/";s:11:"description";s:1869:"<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/25-sneak-peek/">WordPress Development Blog: 2.5 Sneak Peek</a>  I love the staccato description Matt uses to start the post: <em>A customizable dashboard, multi-file upload, built-in galleries, one-click plugin upgrades, tag management, built-in Gravatars, full text feeds, and faster load times sound interesting? </em>The first Release Candidate for WordPress 2.5 is out for those that have been waiting patiently to try out the new features.

It gets the job done, but its myriad options can be overwhelming. The new write screen only displays the information that you’ll use most often. It displays the most common fields in a way that makes posting incredibly easy. Additional options are hidden away until you need them. The new Write screen anticipates the natural flow of the way you write, and is smart enough to remember the way you left it so that your preferred writing environment is always quickly available. The new visual editor even has a handy full-screen mode to help block out distractions while composing your newest post.

We created a special email address just for the occasion: <a href="mailto:2.5-feedback@wordpress.org">2.5-feedback@wordpress.org</a>.</p>\n<p>The software is basically done and stable, and could be released today, but we&#8217;d like to incorporate feedback from a wider audience before making it available to the general public. After a few days of your feedback we&#8217;ll set a final release date. Personally, I can&#8217;t wait. <img src="http://wordpress.org/development/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>";}i:44;a:7:{s:5:"title";s:58:"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress Theme Releases for 3/17";s:4:"guid";s:88:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/03/17/wordpress-theme-releases-for-317-2/";s:4:"link";s:88:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/03/17/wordpress-theme-releases-for-317-2/";s:11:"description";s:2475:"<h3>Two Column Themes</h3>\n<p><strong>CoolWater</strong></p>\n<p><img border="0" width="200" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/03/coolwater-thumbnail.png" alt="coolwater-thumbnail" height="151" /></p>\n<p>CoolWater is a two column widget ready theme which is largely made up of green and blue colors.
