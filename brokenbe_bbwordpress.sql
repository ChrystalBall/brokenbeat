The result is a new way of interacting with WordPress that will remain familiar to seasoned users while improving the experience for everyone. This isn’t just a fresh coat of paint &#8212; we’ve re-thought the look of WordPress, as well as how it’s organized so that you can forget about the software and focus on your own creative pursuits.</p>\n<p>Here are a few vignettes of what&#8217;s in store.</p>\n<h3>The Dashboard</h3>\n<p class="tutscreen"><img src="http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/03/dashboard-wide.png" alt="dashboard-wide.png" /></p>\n<p>The Dashboard’s most important role is to inform quickly and get you to where you’re headed in the admin. In interviewing users, we found that most of you ignore the Dashboard entirely &#8212; its useful information being mostly hidden in an overly complex design. The new Dashboard is focused on the most relevant tasks at hand: a quick summary of what’s published and scheduled for publication, the latest comments and incoming links, blog stats, and WordPress updates and news. You can add your own RSS feeds and edit the way information is presented so that the new Dashboard conforms to the way you use WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Navigation</h3>\n<p class="tutscreen"><img src="http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/03/nav-wide.png" alt="nav-wide.png" /></p>\n<p>The WordPress navigation has confounded even sophisticated users. With the new design, we’ve cut the number of navigation options in half, separating the primary functions (writing, managing posts and pages, editing the blog’s design, and managing comments) from secondary functions. This presents information at a more comfortable pace, revealing only the information that’s necessary. Everything you need is still there &#8212; just better organized.

It gets the job done, but its myriad options can be overwhelming. The new write screen only displays the information that you’ll use most often. It displays the most common fields in a way that makes posting incredibly easy. Additional options are hidden away until you need them. The new Write screen anticipates the natural flow of the way you write, and is smart enough to remember the way you left it so that your preferred writing environment is always quickly available. The new visual editor even has a handy full-screen mode to help block out distractions while composing your newest post. (My personal favorite new feature.)</p>\n<h3>Manage</h3>\n<p class="tutscreen"><img src="http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/03/manage-wide.png" alt="" /></p>\n<p><img class="right" src="http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/03/manage.png" alt="" /></p>\n<p>The Manage screens have been redesigned and unified so that now, managing your pages, posts, media, and comments all use similar, consistent interfaces. We’ve omitted superfluous information and made what’s important faster to find. We believe these changes will make you a faster, more proficient blogger.</p>\n<p>You might also notice there are some new colors, the dashboard feels much fresher and lighter. If you&#8217;re jonesing for the old look under your user options you can now select the &#8220;classic&#8221; colors and get those old blues back. (It&#8217;s also pluggable so people can easily add or share their own color schemes.)</p>\n<p>If you make frequent backups and you&#8217;re interested in helping us out with development by testing the new code, <a href="http://wordpress.org/wordpress-2.5-RC1.zip">download</a> and install <a href="http://wordpress.org/wordpress-2.5-RC1.zip">Release Candidate 1</a> of WordPress 2.5, and <a href="http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-testers">join our testers mailing list</a> to report any bugs you find in the code.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re also interested in feedback on the new interface and would love to hear your opinions, thoughts, rants, raves, and anything in between.

If you&#8217;re jonesing for the old look under your user options you can now select the &#8220;classic&#8221; colors and get those old blues back. (It&#8217;s also pluggable so people can easily add or share their own color schemes.)</p>\n<p>If you make frequent backups and you&#8217;re interested in helping us out with development by testing the new code, <a href="http://wordpress.org/wordpress-2.5-RC1.zip">download</a> and install <a href="http://wordpress.org/wordpress-2.5-RC1.zip">Release Candidate 1</a> of WordPress 2.5, and <a href="http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-testers">join our testers mailing list</a> to report any bugs you find in the code.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re also interested in feedback on the new interface and would love to hear your opinions, thoughts, rants, raves, and anything in between. We created a special email address just for the occasion: <a href="mailto:2.5-feedback@wordpress.org">2.5-feedback@wordpress.org</a>.</p>\n<p>The software is basically done and stable, and could be released today, but we&#8217;d like to incorporate feedback from a wider audience before making it available to the general public. After a few days of your feedback we&#8217;ll set a final release date. Personally, I can&#8217;t wait. <img src=''http://wordpress.org/development/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif'' alt='':)'' class=''wp-smiley'' /></p>\n";}i:2;a:12:{s:5:"title";s:15:"WordPress 2.3.3";s:4:"link";s:55:"http://wordpress.org/development/2008/02/wordpress-233/";s:8:"comments";s:64:"http://wordpress.org/development/2008/02/wordpress-233/#comments";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Tue, 05 Feb 2008 05:02:45 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:4:"Ryan";}s:8:"category";s:11:"Development";s:4:"guid";s:39:"http://wordpress.org/development/?p=225";s:11:"description";s:307:"WordPress 2.3.3 is an urgent security release.

This release includes native tagging support, plugin update notification, URL handling improvements, and much more. This release is named for the great tenor saxophonist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter_Gordon">Dexter Gordon</a>.</p>\n<p>The entire team is really proud of this release, and I&#8217;m happy that this is our second on-time release under our <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/">new development schedule</a>. The grand experiment of a more agile WordPress with significant features in the hands of users more often is working. I could write a blog post about each new feature, but I&#8217;ll try to be brief:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Native tagging support</strong> allows you to use tags in addition to categories on your posts, if you so choose. We&#8217;ve included importers for the Ultimate Tag Warrior, Jerome&#8217;s Keywords, Simple Tags, and Bunny&#8217;s Technorati Tag plugins so if you&#8217;ve already been using a tagging plugin you can bring your data into the new system. The tagging system is also wicked-fast, so your host won&#8217;t mind.</li>\n<li>Our new <strong>update notification</strong> lets you know when there is a new release of WordPress or when any of the plugins you use has an update available. It works by sending your blog URL, plugins, and version information to our new <code>api.wordpress.org</code> service which then compares it to the plugin database and tells you whats the latest and greatest you can use.</li>\n<li>We&#8217;ve cleaned up URLs a bunch in a feature we call <strong>canonical URLs</strong> which does things like enforce your no-www preference, redirect posts with changed slugs so a link never goes bad, redirect URLs that get cut off in emails on similar to the correct post, and much more.

This release includes native tagging support, plugin update notification, URL handling improvements, and much more. This release is named for the great tenor saxophonist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter_Gordon">Dexter Gordon</a>.</p>\n<p>The entire team is really proud of this release, and I&#8217;m happy that this is our second on-time release under our <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/">new development schedule</a>. The grand experiment of a more agile WordPress with significant features in the hands of users more often is working. I could write a blog post about each new feature, but I&#8217;ll try to be brief:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Native tagging support</strong> allows you to use tags in addition to categories on your posts, if you so choose. We&#8217;ve included importers for the Ultimate Tag Warrior, Jerome&#8217;s Keywords, Simple Tags, and Bunny&#8217;s Technorati Tag plugins so if you&#8217;ve already been using a tagging plugin you can bring your data into the new system. The tagging system is also wicked-fast, so your host won&#8217;t mind.</li>\n<li>Our new <strong>update notification</strong> lets you know when there is a new release of WordPress or when any of the plugins you use has an update available. It works by sending your blog URL, plugins, and version information to our new <code>api.wordpress.org</code> service which then compares it to the plugin database and tells you whats the latest and greatest you can use.</li>\n<li>We&#8217;ve cleaned up URLs a bunch in a feature we call <strong>canonical URLs</strong> which does things like enforce your no-www preference, redirect posts with changed slugs so a link never goes bad, redirect URLs that get cut off in emails on similar to the correct post, and much more. This helps your users, and it also <strong>helps your search engine optimization</strong>, as search engines like for each page to be available in one <a href="http://www.answers.com/canonical?cat=technology">canonical</a> location. <a href="http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2007/09/25/wordpress-23-canonical-urls/">More info here</a>.</li>\n<li>Our new <strong>pending review</strong> feature will be great for multi-author blogs. It allows authors to submit a post for review by an editor or administrator, where before they would just have to save a draft and hope someone noticed it.</li>\n<li>There is new <strong>advanced WYSIWYG</strong> functionality (we call it the kitchen sink button) that allows you to access some features of TinyMCE that were previously hidden.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You&#8217;ll notice that two of those features are straight out of the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/?show=popular">most-voted for ideas list</a>.

Not all plugins work nicely with others so be sure to read the installation manual if you decide to use any of these plugins on your own blog.</p>\n<p>1. <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cookies-for-comments/#post-4766" title="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cookies-for-comments/#post-4766" target="_blank"><strong>Comments For Cookies</strong></a> - This plugin adds a stylesheet to your blog&#8217;s html source code. When a browser loads that stylesheet a cookie is dropped. If that user then leaves a comment the cookie is checked. If it doesn&#8217;t exist the comment is marked as spam.</p>\n<p>2. <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bad-behavior/#post-30" title="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bad-behavior/#post-30" target="_blank"><strong>Bad Behavior</strong></a> - Bad Behavior is an awesome comment spam blocking plugin. If you can imagine, Bad Behavior is like Akismet on steroids. BH is a plugin which contains a series of scripts which block comment spam, trackback spam, guestbook spam, wiki spam, and even protects your site from some malicious website hacking. It&#8217;s been rumored that Akismet combined with Bad Behavior is the ultimate anti spam configuration in WordPress.</p>\n<p>3. <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-spamfree/#post-2654" title="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-spamfree/#post-2654" target="_blank"><strong>WP-SpamFree</strong></a> - SpamFree takes a somewhat different approach at combating spam by using a combination of JavaScript and cookies. According to the plugin author, most automated bots are stopped dead in their tracks by using this method while normal web site visitors are unaffected. However, the plugin author does state that there may be a few visitors who have JS and cookies disabled who might be annoyed by this plugin but that those people would be far fewer than the 100% of people which would be annoyed by CAPTCHA&#8217;s, challenge questions and other validation methods.</p>\n<p>4. <a href="http://wp-plugins.net/doc/sk2/" title="http://wp-plugins.net/doc/sk2/" target="_blank"><strong>Spam Karma 2</strong></a> - SK2 is the successor to SpamKarma. SpamKarma2 developed in 2007 is a an anti spam plugin which contains a wide assortment of options with the ability to find tune it&#8217;s effectiveness. SK2 even comes with it&#8217;s own module system where you can download separate modules and add functionality to the original plugin if the default is not enough for you. Despite this plugins age, WordPressers are still chanting about how well this plugin works.</p>\n<p>5. <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/comment-inbox/#post-4907" title="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/comment-inbox/#post-4907" target="_blank"><strong>Comment Inbox</strong></a> - Developed by Mark Jaquith, Comment Inbox gives you the ease of the moderation queue with the freedom of unmoderated comments. Comment Inbox works by placing all comments except caught spam into moderation which is renamed to Comment Inbox. All comments in the Comment Inbox will show up immediately on your blog so conversations don&#8217;t become interrupted by moderation time lines. An effective way of dealing with both spam and bacn on your blog.</p>\n<p>6. <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/captcha-godfather/#post-4871" title="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/captcha-godfather/#post-4871" target="_blank"><strong>CAPTCHA-Godfather</strong></a> - This plugin offers four different methods of protectio. The first is a verification code which is always generated dynamically. The second is that each verification code is given a session id which is different from the PHPSESSID value. The third protection is that every session id and verification code gets their own time stamp. The time stamp works on the premise that humans need a few seconds or minutes to post a comment. The last protection involved IP addresses. The visitor&#8217;s IP is stored with the verification code and only when the comment contains the original IP it&#8217;s then saved and held for moderation.</p>\n<p>7. <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/defensio-anti-spam/#post-2597" title="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/defensio-anti-spam/#post-2597" target="_blank"><strong>Defensio Anti-Spam</strong></a> - This plugin is used by a number of WordPress bloggers. It works similarly in the same way as Akismet as it is an advanced, spam filtering service that learns and adapts to your behaviors and those of your readers. Defensio also includes support for OpenID, detailed statistics and more. With all of this functionality under the hood, it&#8217;s no wonder that this is one of the most popular anti spam plugins in use today, outside of Akismet.</p>\n<p>8. <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/worst-offenders/#post-4830" title="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/worst-offenders/#post-4830" target="_blank"><strong>Worst Offenders</strong></a> - Worst Offenders is a plugin that you can use to help decrease the amount of time you spend looking through messages to determine if they are spam or not. Worst Offenders analyzies messages already marked as spam and then uses several techniques to identify messages with common sources, subjects, and content. The messages marked as Worst Offenders can then be deleted all at once, leaving only a handful of messages to sift through.</p>\n<p>9. <strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-captcha-free/#post-4718" title="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-captcha-free/#post-4718" target="_blank">WP Captcha-Free</a> </strong>- WP Captcha-Free blocks automated comment spam without resorting to CAPTCHAs. It does so by validating a hash based on time (and some other parameters) using AJAX when the form is posted. Comments posted via automated means will not have a hash or will have an expired hash and will be rejected. Unlike using a captcha, this does not place any burden on the commenter.</p>\n<p>10. <strong>Akismet</strong> - There is no way in which I am going to write about spam blocking plugins and not include Akismet. Current versions of WordPress come with <a href="http://www.akismet.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.akismet.com/">Akismet</a> installed by default. Akismet uses a unique algorithm combined with a community-created database to &#8220;learn&#8221; which comments are comment spam and which are legitimate.</p>\n<p>The default configuration for Akismet may not be enough for some. In my own experience, I&#8217;ve noticed that by check marking the configuration option to allow Akismet to automatically discard spam comments on posts that are older than a month has dramatically lowered the amount of spam in my moderation queue.</p>\n<p>As for myself, I am perfectly content with the performance I have received out of Akismet. However, I must note that some of the success tied into Akismet deals with the way I have configured commenting in general on my own personal blog. For example, for a comment to appear on my blog, a user must fill out the name and email text fields. They must also contain a previously approved comment. I have also configured my comment moderation settings to place comments in the moderation queue if they contain two or more links.</p>\n<p>Everyone&#8217;s comment spam/configuration circumstances are different, so be sure to experiment with different options or techniques to figure out which comment spam blocking recipe works for you.

There are typically four actions you can perform on a message in your Gmail inbox (other than reading it, that is): reply, archive, mark as spam, delete.

Although the Happy Cog redesign of the comment management screens is worlds better, it didn&#8217;t fundamentally address the speeding train issue.

The result is a new way of interacting with WordPress that will remain familiar to seasoned users while improving the experience for everyone. This isn’t just a fresh coat of paint &#8212; we’ve re-thought the look of WordPress, as well as how it’s organized so that you can forget about the software and focus on your own creative pursuits.</p>\n<p>Here are a few vignettes of what&#8217;s in store.</p>\n<h3>The Dashboard</h3>\n<p class="tutscreen"><img src="http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/03/dashboard-wide.png" alt="dashboard-wide.png" /></p>\n<p>The Dashboard’s most important role is to inform quickly and get you to where you’re headed in the admin. In interviewing users, we found that most of you ignore the Dashboard entirely &#8212; its useful information being mostly hidden in an overly complex design. The new Dashboard is focused on the most relevant tasks at hand: a quick summary of what’s published and scheduled for publication, the latest comments and incoming links, blog stats, and WordPress updates and news. You can add your own RSS feeds and edit the way information is presented so that the new Dashboard conforms to the way you use WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Navigation</h3>\n<p class="tutscreen"><img src="http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/03/nav-wide.png" alt="nav-wide.png" /></p>\n<p>The WordPress navigation has confounded even sophisticated users. With the new design, we’ve cut the number of navigation options in half, separating the primary functions (writing, managing posts and pages, editing the blog’s design, and managing comments) from secondary functions. This presents information at a more comfortable pace, revealing only the information that’s necessary. Everything you need is still there &#8212; just better organized. (Especially for people new to WP.)</p>\n<h3>Write</h3>\n<p class="tutscreen"><img src="http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/03/write-wide.png" alt="write-wide.png" /></p>\n<p><img class="right" src="http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/03/write3.png" alt="write2.png" /></p>\n<p>By far, the most frequently accessed part of WordPress is the Write screen. It gets the job done, but its myriad options can be overwhelming. The new write screen only displays the information that you’ll use most often. It displays the most common fields in a way that makes posting incredibly easy. Additional options are hidden away until you need them. The new Write screen anticipates the natural flow of the way you write, and is smart enough to remember the way you left it so that your preferred writing environment is always quickly available. The new visual editor even has a handy full-screen mode to help block out distractions while composing your newest post. (My personal favorite new feature.)</p>\n<h3>Manage</h3>\n<p class="tutscreen"><img src="http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/03/manage-wide.png" alt="" /></p>\n<p><img class="right" src="http://wpcom.wordpress.com/files/2008/03/manage.png" alt="" /></p>\n<p>The Manage screens have been redesigned and unified so that now, managing your pages, posts, media, and comments all use similar, consistent interfaces. We’ve omitted superfluous information and made what’s important faster to find. We believe these changes will make you a faster, more proficient blogger.</p>\n<p>You might also notice there are some new colors, the dashboard feels much fresher and lighter. If you&#8217;re jonesing for the old look under your user options you can now select the &#8220;classic&#8221; colors and get those old blues back.

It&#8217;s been an exciting few months for us since we&#8217;ve taken on the role of helping Gravatar grow.  We&#8217;ve been doing a lot of work to get those gears turning, and set things up for some serious forward motion.</p>\n<p>The first thing we did, after stabilizing the service, was set out to rewrite Gravatar in PHP.  Now before we launch into any holy wars I&#8217;d like to point out that our decision on this matter had nothing to do with Ruby, or Rails &#8212; in fact we have a great respect for both!  The reason, the only reason, we switched is that PHP is our core competency at Automattic.  As a PHP application we will be able to apply the sum total of our collective abilities to bear on any problems that Gravatar might face.  The guys I work with are genuinely some of the most technically gifted people I know!</p>\n<p>Of the things that you might notice there are a couple which will be most prominent.  First off the speed of the user interface has increased dramatically especially when it comes to applying your uploaded imaged to your email addresses, a process which used to take minutes.  We&#8217;ve fixed the biggest issue with the cropper (it would throw an error if you tried to use an image that was already 80&#215;80 pixels or smaller.)</p>\n<p>Now for some things that you probably have not noticed.</p>\n<p>We have increased the size limit for avatars to 512 pixels (thats a big avatar!)  With existing gravatars the image will be pixelated at 512, but new gravatars created from from higher resolution images will be very clear.

I was never able to replicate it and despite my efforts to track down the bug it remained unfixed. Well, I fixed that bug thanks to <a href="http://www.village-idiot.org/">whooami</a> and to <a href="http://thehathorlegacy.info/">Jennifer</a> who allowed me to login to her server and debug my script. <a href="http://barry.wordpress.com/">Barry</a> was astute enough to figure out why it happened.</p>\n<p>Other changes include:\n<ul>\n<li> Compressed cache files are deleted properly now, props <a href="http://onemansblog.com/">John Pozadzides</a>.</li>\n<li> Documentation got a serious update. I added a FAQ, and the Troubleshooting section has been expanded.</li>\n<li> The .htaccess is not updated until the user clicks a button in the backend now.</li>\n<li> The listing of cached files is gone for this release as it was inaccurate. It didn&#8217;t include super cached files.</li>\n<li> The backend admin page has been rearranged slightly.
